# Feliclare's Portfolio

## Description

As this week's lessons have come to a close, we were given the task to express how much we learned and retained. We were given more tools that allowed us to give our websites more detail and responsiveness. Even make them a little prettier. In this project, I heavily relied on the internet to help me code my stylesheet. CSS has been frustrating but its honestly really cool to see how it styles plain text.

## Website

Here are screenshots of my website's layout.
