                    <p id="description">Hi! My name is Feliclare, but you may call me Feli. I was born and raised in Waipahu, Hawai'i, located on the busy little island of O'ahu. I have two dogs, Miso (4) and Yuri, (9) who are stuck to me like opihi. Luckily, they are ridiculously low maintenance and enjoy sleeping all day. Although, they are long-haired dogs so you'll catch me vacuuming every single day. On my days off, I like to rewatch shows and crochet. I'm a big fan of Pok√©mon and have been since 1998.
                        <br><br>I moved to Washington in March 2020, right before the quarantine/global shutdown due to the pandemic. Hawai'i will forever be my home, but I wanted to give myself the chance and explore the abundance of opportunities the mainland had to offer. Fast forward to the end of 2022, and I am looking for more. I currently work for the University of Washington, Virology department as a Clinical Laboratory Technician Lead. I was interested in this coding bootcamp as a way to open new pathways for my career--maybe even change it. Let's see what the future holds for us!
